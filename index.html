                    <p>One of my earliest talents is drawing, which I discovered in kindergarten. I continued drawing
                         throughout high school and saw significant progress in my skills. Whenever I felt bored at school,
                          I would draw anything that came to mind. Unfortunately, I have stopped drawing for now, and Iâ€™ve
                           noticed my skills slowly declining.

                    <p>When I was in high school, my classmates encouraged me to join Taekwondo. Once I joined,
                         I really enjoyed it and kept training. Unfortunately, I had to stop due to other responsibilities.
                         However, during the pandemic, I was able to train on my own. Later in college,
                          I became one of the fighters representing my school in a tournament.

                    <p>I discovered my acting skills in college,
                         not professionally but purely for fun. There were many projects during
                          my first year, and my first acting experience was in the 2023-2024 intramurals,
                           where I volunteered for a video mimic performance. This was followed by the PSITS
                            movie spoof and PSITS short film projects
